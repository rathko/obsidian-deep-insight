## Key Features

Transform your Obsidian vault into actionable insights using AI-powered patterns. Deep Insight analyzes your notes to uncover tasks and patterns that align with your goals and values.

- ü§ñ Powered by Claude 3.5 and OpenAI GPT-4o AI models (Sonnet, Haiku, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini)
- üìù Analyzes every Markdown file in your vault (you can exclude chosen folders) or selected folders/notes
- üéØ Generates prioritized tasks based on note context and your own **core values, goals and beliefs**. 
- üß¨ Pattern-based analysis using [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) patterns
- üîÑ Context menu integration for quick pattern execution
- ‚ö° Processes large vaults in manageable chunks / batches
- üí∞ Provides cost estimates for AI usage  

*Note: Only markdown files (.md) are analyzed; other file types like PDFs, images, etc., are excluded.*

## Setup

1. Install via Obsidian Community Plugins or manually
2. Get API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Configure in plugin settings:
   - Enter API key
   - Choose AI model
   - Set excluded folders
   - Customize prompts
   - Install Fabric patterns

Note: Alternatively, see [docs](./docs) on how to install latest version manually.

## How to Use

1. Open any note where you want to insert generated tasks (like your daily note)
2. Select with the cursos the location where generated tasks should be inserted
3. Open the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + P)
4. Search for "Deep Insight". Use "Generate Insights and Tasks from Notes" option to generate tasks or "Run Pattern" to analyse your vault with a specific Fabric pattern.
5. Alternatively, right click on a folder or a note and choose "Run Pattern" option to analyse selected notes with Fabric patterns.
5. The plugin will generate tasks/insights and insert them in your chosen location

## Pattern-Based Analysis

## Usage

1. Place cursor where you want to insert generated content
2. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + P)
3. Choose "Generate Insights and Tasks from Notes" or "Run Pattern"
4. Alternatively, right-click on files/folders to run patterns

## Patterns

Patterns are AI prompts that analyze your content in specific ways:

1. Install sample patterns from plugin settings
2. Download more from [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)
3. Create custom patterns in the "Deep Insight Patterns" folder

Pattern structure:
```
patterns/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pattern-name/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system.md    # System instructions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user.md      # Optional user context for a given pattern
```

## FAQ

### Q: Is the AI controlling me through my tasks?
A: AI is just a glorified note-reader that reminds you of commitments you already wrote. You're still the one calling the shots... for now.

### Q: Why aren't tasks generating?
A: Check these three things:
- API key is valid
- Internet connection is active

### Q: How does it align with my goals?
A: Define your mission, values, and objectives in the User Prompt - the plugin prioritizes tasks that support these core principles.

### Q: What files can it process?
A: Markdown (.md) files only. Other formats are excluded for focused analysis.

### Q: What are the costs?
A: On my personal vault (hundreds of notes):
- ~$0.15 per run using GPT-4o mini
- ~$5/month for daily reviews
- Cost estimates are shown upfront, YMMV
- If your estimated costs are too high, stop processing anytime by closing Obsidian
- Reduce costs by excluding folders in settings

### Q: How does chunking work?
A: Large vaults are processed in smaller batches to:
- Stay within API limits
- Maintain context
- Process efficiently
Expect a few minutes for larger vaults.

### Q: Which AI provider should I choose?
A: Both work well, but OpenAI has stricter quotas. If hitting limits with GPT-4o, try GPT-4o mini or Anthropic.

### Q: Is my data secure?
A: Yes - notes are transferred securely between your vault and the AI providers (Anthropic/OpenAI). No data is stored elsewhere or used for training without explicit opt-in.

Both OpenAI and Anthropic do not use data submitted via API for training, unless user specifically opted in.
