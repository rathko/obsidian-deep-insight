## Your Vault Is a Goldmine ‚Äî But Are You Missing What Matters?

Inside your vault lies:

- Follow-ups silently slipping through the cracks

Deep Insight eliminates the chaos and brings clarity:
- Analyzes every Markdown note with AI-driven prompts
- Extracts actionable tasks tailored to your goals
- Finds recurring themes and big-picture insights
- Surfaces forgotten deadlines and overlooked priorities
- Preserves your folder structure while uncovering value
- Delivers insights, your way

Let Deep Insight be your personal assistant, surfacing the most important insights‚Äîaligned with your **goals, values, and beliefs** ‚Äî so you never lose sight of what truly matters.

5. Access advanced settings:
   - Test mode to reduce costs during experimentation with prompts
   - Max tokens per request (default 100k; reduce if needed)
   - Retry attempts for processing large vaults more smoothly

## How to Use

1. Open any note where you want to insert generated tasks (like your daily note)
2. Select with the cursos the location where generated tasks should be inserted
3. Open the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + P)
4. Search for "Deep Insight: Generate Insights from Notes"
5. The plugin will generate tasks/insights and insert them in your chosen location

*Note: Only markdown files (.md) are analyzed; other file types like PDFs, images, etc., are excluded.*

## Customization

### Custom Prompts

Tailor the behavior of the AI by adjusting the types of prompts used in your workflow:

- **System Prompt:** Defines how the AI approaches analysis‚Äîlike instructions for a personal assistant. Customize to set task formats, note categorizations, priorities, and style.
- **User Prompt:** Here is where you define **your mission, purpose, goals and beliefs** and any additional instructions

### How to Set Custom Prompts

1. Create notes in your vault for each type of prompt
2. Link them in the plugin settings using "Select Note"
3. Once the prompt note was selected, you can edit it directly in Obsidian as needed

### AI Models

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Best for detailed analysis and task extraction
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku:** Affordable task generation for smaller note sets
- **OpenAI GPT 4o:** OpenAI Advanced Model, for detailed analysis and task extraction
- **OpenAI GPT 4o mini:** OpenAI Affordable Model, for quick task extraction

## FAQ

### Q: Is the AI controlling me through my tasks?
A: AI is just a glorified note-reader that reminds you of commitments you already wrote. No mind control here - unless you count being reminded of that project deadline you tried to forget. You're still the one calling the shots... for now.

### Q: Why aren‚Äôt tasks being generated?
A: Check if:
1. Your API key is correctly set
2. You have an active internet connection
3. Folders aren‚Äôt accidentally excluded in the settings

### Q: How do I align outcomes with my goals and values?
A: Update the User Prompt in settings or link it to a custom note that reflects your goals and priorities. Use Test Mode to tweak prompts‚Äîthis processes just a handful of files per run, making it easy to fine-tune the insights to match what truly matters to you.

### Q: What file types does the plugin process?
A: The plugin only processes Markdown (.md) files. Other file types (images, PDFs, etc.) are ignored to keep the analysis focused and efficient.

### Q: How expensive is it to run?
A: It‚Äôs affordable with control in your hands. For my own vault with thousands of notes from the last few years - using GPT-4o mini, it‚Äôs around $0.15 per run ‚Äî roughly $5/month for daily reviews. Larger vault? You might want to exclude folders in settings for big savings. Prefer a more advanced and pricier model? Costs can rise. The plugin estimates costs upfront‚Äîif it‚Äôs too high, close Obsidian while the plugin is running (this will stop processing), reopen and tweak exclusions in settings, and try again.

### Q: How does chunking work?
A: Chunking (batching) helps by processing notes in smaller sections to:
1. Handle large vaults efficiently
2. Stay within API context token limits
3. Maintain context across related notes

It might take a few minutes to process a larger vault. For best results think carefully whether there are more folders you can exclude from processing. Using more affordable model (GPT-4o mini or Haiku can help reduce costs). 

### Q: Can I integrate other AI models?
A: The plugin currently supports Claude 3.5 and OpenAI GPT-4o models. Pull requests are gladly accepted!

### Q: Should I use OpenAI or Anthropic?
A: While both AI providers work quite well, OpenAI tends to have more strict API quotas, especially with the GPT-4o model. If you see frequent errors related to hitting OpenAI quota limits, you might try GPT-4o mini or Anthropic.

### Q: How is my data handled?
A: Your notes are transferred only between your Obsidian vault and Anthropic's Claude / OpenAI. No data is stored or transmitted elsewhere, ensuring complete privacy.

Both OpenAI and Anthropic do not use data submitted via API for training, unless user specifically opted in.
