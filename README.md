It's like having a personal assistant that reads your entire vault, understands your workflow, and knows what to highlight based on your preferences.

## Customization

### Custom Prompts

Tailor the behavior of the AI by adjusting the types of prompts used in your workflow:

- **System Prompt:** Defines how the AI approaches analysis‚Äîlike instructions for a personal assistant. Customize to set task formats, note categorizations, priorities, and style. Here is where you define **your purpose and goals**.
- **User Prompt:** Asks the assistant for specific insights or tasks. E.g., extract project deadlines, summarize ideas, or find research notes.
- **Combination Prompt:** Prompt used for combining insights from large vaults processed over multiple chunks / batches.

### How to Set Custom Prompts

1. Create notes in your vault for each type of prompt
2. Link them in the plugin settings using "Select Note"
3. Once the prompt note was selected, you can edit it directly in Obsidian as needed

Examples:
- Use specific prompts for different workflows (e.g., one for task management, one for creative brainstorming)
- Test and refine prompts to match your output needs

## FAQ

### Q: Is the AI controlling me through my tasks?
A: Nope! The AI just reads your notes and reminds you what you wrote - like having a photographic memory without the supervillain origin story. It surfaces your own thoughts and plans; you're still the one calling the shots.

### Q: Why aren‚Äôt tasks being generated?
A: Check if:
1. Your API key is correctly set
2. You have an active internet connection
3. Folders aren‚Äôt accidentally excluded in the settings

### Q: What file types does the plugin process?
A: The plugin only processes Markdown (.md) files. Other file types (images, PDFs, etc.) are ignored to keep the analysis focused and efficient.

### Q: How does chunking work?
A: Chunking helps by processing notes in smaller sections to:
1. Handle large vaults efficiently
2. Stay within API token limits
3. Maintain context across related notes

### Q: Can I integrate other AI models?
A: The plugin currently supports only Claude 3.5 models. We gladly accept pull requests!

### Q: How is my data handled?
A: Your notes are only processed between your Obsidian vault and Anthropic (Claude AI). No data is stored or transmitted elsewhere, ensuring complete privacy.
