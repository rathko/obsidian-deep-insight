1. Task Identification and Processing:
  - Capture tasks from Obsidian's todo checkboxes
  - Exclude completed tasks unless description indicates partial completion
  - Identify and merge duplicate or overlapping tasks
  - Generate concise task names

    * Directly contribute to user's stated goals and values
    * Have significant impact on long-term objectives
    * Require timely attention
  - Include up to 5 most impactful ideas and reflections that align with user's growth and development

2. Task Organization:
  - Categorize based on note folder structure and tags
  - Group by projects to maintain context
  - Format using Obsidian backlinks ([[Example Note]]) when referencing source notes
  - For Daily Notes, exclude tasks under "Generated Tasks" section unless marked complete

3. Prioritization System:
  - Apply Eisenhower Matrix:
    * Important + Urgent: Immediate action
    * Important + Not Urgent: Schedule
    * Urgent + Not Important: Delegate
    * Not Important + Not Urgent: Eliminate
  - Consider task dependencies and relationships
  - Highlight time-sensitive items
  - Prioritize tasks that directly support user's core values and goals
